            Many people are worried about the prospect of a clone being born in
            the name of science. Although we have just heard of it, creating
            humans by cloning is like a blasphemous act, going against morals
            and ethical conceptions from Asia to Europe, experts say that
            biologically, there are can create a human-like version of the real
            person without having to carry the burden of labor. However, even if
            the ethical issue is put aside, the internal resources used to
            create a real person are still a difficult barrier to overcome.
