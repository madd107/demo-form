            Many people are worried about the prospect of a clone being born in
            the name of science. Although we have just heard of it, creating
            humans by cloning is like a blasphemous act, going against morals
            and ethical conceptions from Asia to Europe, experts say that
            biologically, there are can create a human-like version of the real
            person without having to carry the burden of labor. However, even if
            the ethical issue is put aside, the internal resources used to
            create a real person are still a difficult barrier to overcome.

            Since the 1950s, when researchers successfully cloned a frog, since
            then experts have "produced" dozens of animals, including mice,
            cats, sheep, pigs, and cows. In each case, they always face problems
            that need to be overcome, according to Fox News, Dr. Robert Lanza of
            Advanced Cell Technology, which works in the field of cell therapy
            to treat diseases. for humans and animal cloning. With mice,
            researchers can use thousands of eggs and run many experiments to
            find ways to handle errors in the implementation. "It's like a
            counting game," says Dr. Lanza. However, in the case of primates,
            eggs are a very rare and not easily available resource for
            experiments. Besides, they couldn't simply apply what they learned
            by cloning mice or cows to humans. For example, cloning animals
            requires researchers to first remove the nucleus of an egg cell. In
            doing this, they also removed all the proteins needed to support
            cell division. This was not a problem in the mice, as the ovum
            produced was still able to produce these proteins again. However,
            primates can't do that, and researchers say this is one of the
            reasons why attempts to clone monkeys have failed. And yet, cloning
            animals often leads to all sorts of genetic abnormalities,
            preventing implantation of the ovum in the uterus, or causing
            embryos to be rejected, or test subjects to die shortly after birth.
            These abnormalities are quite common when cloning animals because
            embryos are implanted with only one parent instead of both as in the
            case of natural conception. This means that the molecular process is
            known as “genomic imprinting” does not take place in the correct
            sequence in cloned embryos. Having trouble at this stage can lead to
            the placenta being many times larger than usual, hindering the blood
            circulation to the fetus. In one experiment, Dr. Lanza and
            colleagues cloned a species of cattle called a banteng bison. And
            the animal was born at twice the normal size, forcing the team of
            experts to perform euthanasia for it. In addition to the usual moral
            problems, the extremely high mortality rate and the risk of
            developing deformities further expose the work of cloning to face
            fierce opposition from society. “It's like putting your baby on a
            rocket and knowing that the probability of exploding is 50-50.
            Downright unethical,” concludes Dr. Lanza.
